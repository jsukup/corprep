# The corporate reputation app is a side project to test the utility of LLMs, LangChain, vector databases, etc. in analyzing public sentiment of organizations.

Currently, the project uses [Newscatcher API](https://newscatcherapi.com/) for document ingestion but long term, the goal is to provide additional resources for multimodel search and evaluation of LangChain features including AI agents.
